# World Weather Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to create code to take in user input for minimum and maximum temperatures and find current recommendations for hotels based on that input with Google Maps and Places API and OpenWeatherMap API. We also did an exploritory analysis on linear regression for the Northern and Southern hemisphere for temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 

## Project Overview:
1. Collect 2000 random latitudes and longitudes to use the OpenWeatherMap API to parse the JSON data into a dataframe. 
2. Analyze and create visualizations for latitude vs temp, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 
3. Create heatmaps using Google Maps and Places API. 
4. Add user input for minimum and maximum temperatures for travel recommendations based on current weather conditions.
5. Create a travel trip with Google Maps and Places API with closest hotels and current weather conditions within the user specified minimum and maximum temperatures.

### The analysis
- What are two conclusions you can draw?

- What can you conclude?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
